# safe-explicit-project-rule

## Project Context
- This is a real codebase with existing contracts.
- Stability and correctness matter more than speed.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Backend: REST-style API
- Authentication: Context-based

## Coding Standards
- Use strict TypeScript (no `any` unless explicitly approved).
- Prefer functional components.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Follow existing patterns in the repository.

## Creation Policy
- New APIs, files, or libraries are allowed ONLY if:
  - Explicitly requested, OR
  - Clearly proposed and approved first.
- Never assume backend endpoints or data shapes.

## Change Management
- For multi-file changes:
  1. Explain intent
  2. Propose a minimal plan
  3. List files to be modified
- After changes:
  - Summarize what changed
  - Explain how to test or verify

## Forbidden
- No silent breaking changes
- No unnecessary refactors
- No dependency creep
