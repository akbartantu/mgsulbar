## project-docs-first-workflow

This project must follow a documentation-first workflow.

### mandatory documents
Every project MUST have and maintain these documents:

1. master-plan.md  
   - Defines product scope, modules, pages, use cases, workflows, and data sources.
   - Structure must follow the MGANZ master plan pattern:
     - module classification
     - pages per module
     - use cases with workflow + data read/write
     - governance rules

2. sprint-planning.md  
   - Defines sprint goal, scope, user stories, acceptance criteria.
   - Aligned with the master plan.
   - Only features defined in the master plan may appear here.

3. qa-testing-guide.md  
   - Written per sprint.
   - Uses US / TC format.
   - Defines step-by-step test cases, expected results, and completion criteria.

4. troubleshooting-guide.md  
   - Logs problems, causes, fixes, and verification steps.
   - Updated whenever issues or workarounds are discovered.

### working rules
- Start every new project or major feature by creating or updating ALL four documents.
- Do not write or modify implementation code before these documents exist.
- When requirements or behavior change:
  - update the relevant document first
  - then update code to match the document
- Documents are the source of truth.
- Code that contradicts documentation is considered incorrect.

### forbidden behavior
- Do not skip documentation.
- Do not keep docs outdated.
- Do not implement features that are not documented.
