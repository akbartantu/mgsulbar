the project uses a single app tree in dawet-repo (no on production / ready to deploy folders).

dawet-repo:
- contains the full app (frontend, server, docs) and mirrors the GitHub repo
- used for both development and deployment
- all new files and features must be created here

render deployment:
- root directory is dawet-repo
- no promotion step; push to the connected branch triggers deploy

fallback rule:
- if uncertain, work in dawet-repo
