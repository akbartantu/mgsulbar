# scrum-sprint-kickoff

Start a new sprint using scrum methodology.

Create or update the following documents using kebab-case filenames:
- sprint-planning.md
- qa-testing-guide.md
- troubleshooting-guide.md

Follow these rules strictly:
- qa-testing-guide.md must follow the standard qa document structure used in previous sprints
- include testing overview, environment setup, and test cases by user story
- use user story ids (us-x.y) and test case ids (tc-x.y.z)

Ask me for:
- sprint number
- sprint goal
- modules in scope
- user roles involved

Do not implement code yet.
This step is planning and documentation only.
